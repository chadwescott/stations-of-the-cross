                <p>I beg you, Lord,
                    help me accept the partings that must come&#9473;
                    from friends who go away,
                    my children leaving home,
                    and most of all, my dear ones
                    when you shall call them to ytourself.</p>
                <p>Then, give me grace to say:
                    "As it has pleased you, Lord,
                    to take them home,
                    I bow to your most holy will.
                    And if by just one word
                    I might restore their lives against your will,
                    I would not speak."
                    Grant them eternal joy.</p>
