                <p>I told you at the start, my other self,
                    my life was not complete
                    until I crowned it by my death.
                    Your "way" is not complete
                    unless you crown it by your life.</p>
                <p>Accept each moment as it comes to you,
                    with faith and trust
                    that all that happens has my mark on it.
                    A simple <em>fiat</em> is all it takes;
                    a breathing in your heart,
                    "I will it, Lord."</p>
