                <p>My Jesus, Lord,
                    I take my daily cross.
                    I welcome the montony
                    that often marks my day,
                    discomforts of all kinds,
                    the summer's heat, the winter's cold,
                    my disappointments, tensions, setbacks, cares.</p>
                <p>Remind me often that
                    in carrying my cross,
                    I carry yours with you.
                    And though I bear a sliver only
                    of your cross,
                    You carry all of mine, except a sliver,
                    in return.</p>
