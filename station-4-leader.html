                <p>My mother sees me whipped.
                    She sees me kicked and driven like a beast.
                    She counts my every wound.
                    But though her soul cries out in agony,
                    no protest or complaint
                    escapes her lips
                    or even enters her thoughts.</p>
                <p>She shares my martyrdom&#9473;
                    and I share hers.
                    We hide no pain, no sorrow,
                    from each other's eyes.
                    This is my Father's will.</p>
