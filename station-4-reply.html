                <p>My Jesus, Lord,
                    I know what you are telling me.
                    To watch the pain of those we love
                    is harder than to bear our own.</p>
                <p>To carry my cross after you,
                    I, too, must stand and watch
                    the sufferings of my dear ones&#9473;
                    the heartaches, sicknesses, and grief
                    of those I love.</p>
                <p>And I must let them watch mine, too.</p>
                <p>I do believe&#9473;
                    for those who love you
                    all things work together unto good.</p>
