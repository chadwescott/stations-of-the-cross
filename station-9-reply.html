                <p>My Lord,
                    I see you take a moment's rest
                    then rise and stagger on.
                    So I can do&#9473;
                    because my will is mine.</p>
                <p>When all my strength is gone
                    and guilt and self-reproach
                    press me to earth and seem to hold me fast,
                    protect me from the sin of Judas&#9473;
                    save me from despair!</p>
                <p>Lord, never let me feel
                    that any sin of mine is greater than your love.
                    No matter what my past has been
                    I can begin anew.</p>
