                <p>My Jesus, Lord,
                    you know my spirit is as willing
                    as my flesh is weak.</p>
                <p>The teaching you could not impart,
                    the sufferings you could not bear,
                    the works of love you could not do
                    in your short life on earth,
                    let me impart,
                    and bear,
                    and do
                    through you.</p>
                <p>But I am nothing, Lord.
                    Help me!</p>
