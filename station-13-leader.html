                <p>The sacrifice is done.</p>
                <p>Yes, my Mass is complete;
                    but not my mother's
                    and not yours, my other self.</p>
                <p>My mother still must cradle in her arms
                    the lifeless body of the son she bore.</p>
                <p>You, too, must part from those you love,
                    and grief will come to you.</p>
                <p>In your bereavements think of this:
                    A multitude of souls were saved
                    by Mary's sharing in my Calvary.
                    Your grief can also be
                    the price of souls.</p>
