                <p>This cross,
                    this chunk of tree,
                    is what my Father chose for me.</p>
                <p>The crosses you must bear are largely producst of your daily life.
                    And yet my Father chose them, too,
                    for you.</p>
                <p>Receive them from his hands.</p>
                <p>Take heart, my other self,
                    I will not let your burdens grow
                    one ounce too heavy for your strength.</p>
