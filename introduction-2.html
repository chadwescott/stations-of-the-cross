                <p>And therefore
                    my way of the cross
                    two thousand years ago
                    and your "way" now
                    are also one.</p>
                <p>But note this difference.
                    My life was incomplete until I crowned it
                    by my death.
                    Your fourteen steps
                    will only be complete when you have crowned them
                    by your life.</p>
