                <p>How often had I longed to take
                    the children of Jerusalem
                    and gather them to me.
                    But they refused.</p>
                <p>But now these women weep for me
                    and my heart mourns for them&#9473;
                    mourns for their sorrows that will come.</p>
                <p>I comfort those who seek to solace me.</p>
                <p>How gentle can you be, my other self?
                    How kind?</p>
