                <p>The God that made the universe,
                    and holds it in existence
                    by his will alone,
                    becomes a man, too weak to bear
                    a piece of timber's wieght.</p>
                <p>How human in his weakness is the Son of God.</p>
                <p>My Father willed it thus.
                    I could not be your model otherwise.</p>
                <p>If you would be my other self,
                    you also must accept without complaint
                    your human frailities.</p>
